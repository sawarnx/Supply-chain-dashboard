## 🔴 The Business Problem

> A global e-commerce company is losing customer trust — but **nobody knows exactly where, why, or how badly.**

Logistics managers had no single view of delivery performance. Orders were being shipped, but:
- Were they arriving **on time?**
- Were they arriving **complete?**
- Which **regions** were failing most?
- Which **shipping modes** were worth the premium cost?

**Without answers, every corrective action was a guess.**

---

## ✅ What I Built

A **4-page interactive Power BI dashboard** backed by a fully engineered SQL Server data warehouse — giving logistics managers a single source of truth to isolate bottlenecks, quantify failures, and prioritize corrective action in real time.

## 💥 Key Findings

| # | Finding | Business Impact |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 🔴 **1** | **First Class shipping: 100% SLA breach** across all 23 regions | Customers pay premium price, receive worst service |
| 🔴 **2** | **OTD rate: 40.9%** vs 85%+ industry benchmark | Less than half of all orders arrive on time |
| 🔴 **3** | **South of USA: 2nd worst globally** at 39.5% OTD | Regional bottleneck confirmed and quantified |
| 🔴 **4** | **Perfect Order Rate: only 14%** | 86% of orders fail on at least one dimension |
| 🔴 **5** | **OTD flat below 45% across 36 months** | Structural failure — not a temporary disruption |

**What it shows:**
- 7 KPI scorecards: OTD (40.9%), OTIF (40.9%), SLA Breach (57.3%), Perfect Order (14%), Revenue ($36.8M), Profit ($4.0M), Avg Days to Ship (3.5)
- Side-by-side color-coded bar charts: OTD Rate vs SLA Breach Rate by shipping mode
- Key finding callout: First Class = 0% OTD, 100% SLA breach

---

### Page 2 — Regional Analysis
> *Which regions are failing — and by exactly how much?*

![Regional Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawarnx/supply-chain-logistics-dashboard/main/Screenshots/page2_regional_analysis.png)

**What it shows:**
- All 23 global regions ranked worst → best by OTD rate
- Interactive slicers: filter by Year (2015/2016/2017) and Shipping Mode
- Color-coded KPI table with 6 metrics per region
- South of USA (39.5%) and Central Africa (38.4%) flagged as critical

---

### Page 3 — SLA Heatmap
> *Which region + shipping mode combination is most broken?*

![SLA Heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawarnx/supply-chain-logistics-dashboard/main/Screenshots/page3_sla_heatmap.png)

**What it shows:**
- 23 × 4 interactive matrix (Regions × Shipping Modes)
- 🔴 Red = Critical (≥80% breach) | 🟠 Orange = High Risk | 🟢 Green = Acceptable
- Entire First Class column is Critical (100%) across all 23 regions
- Standard Class is the only mode with acceptable performance globally

---

### Page 4 — Trend Analysis
> *Has performance improved over 3 years?*

![Trend Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawarnx/supply-chain-logistics-dashboard/main/Screenshots/page4_trend_analysis.png)

**What it shows:**
- 36-month OTD vs SLA Breach trend lines (2015–2017)
- Monthly order volume (consistent ~5,000 orders/month)
- Perfect Order Rate vs 85% industry benchmark line
- Verdict: **Zero improvement — flat lines confirm a structural problem**

## 🐍 Python EDA Highlights

### Delivery Performance by Shipping Mode
![Delay by Shipping Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawarnx/supply-chain-logistics-dashboard/main/Python/plot1_delay_by_shipmode.png)

*Predicted risk score vs actual late delivery rate — First Class predicted risky AND actually worst performer*

---

### On-Time Delivery Rate by Region
![Delay by Region](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawarnx/supply-chain-logistics-dashboard/main/Python/plot2_delay_by_region.png)

*All 23 regions clustered between 38–46% OTD — no region close to the 85% benchmark*

### Star Schema
```
                      DIM_Date
                         │
DIM_Customer ──── FACT_Orders (180,519 rows) ──── DIM_Shipping

### KPI Engineering (Python)
```python
# Binary flags engineered as new columns
is_on_time       = delivery_status in ['Advance shipping', 'Shipping on time']
is_complete      = order_status == 'COMPLETE'
is_sla_breach    = days_shipping_real > days_shipping_scheduled
is_otif          = is_on_time AND is_qty_fulfilled
is_perfect_order = is_on_time AND is_complete AND NOT is_sla_breach
days_variance    = days_shipping_real - days_shipping_scheduled
```

### SQL KPI Views
```sql
VW_KPI_Summary           -- Overall KPI scorecards        (1 row)
VW_KPI_By_ShippingMode   -- Performance by shipping mode  (4 rows)

## 📈 KPI Definitions & Results

| KPI | Definition | Our Result | Industry Benchmark |
|-----|-----------|------------|--------------------|
| **OTD** | % orders delivered on time | 🔴 40.9% | 85%+ |
| **OTIF** | % on time AND complete quantity | 🔴 40.9% | 90%+ |
| **SLA Breach** | % shipments exceeding promised days | 🔴 57.3% | <15% |
| **Perfect Order** | On-time + complete + undamaged + accurate | 🔴 14.0% | 80%+ |
| **Fill Rate** | % of order quantity fulfilled immediately | 🟢 100% | 95%+ |
| **Avg Days to Ship** | Average actual shipping days | 🟠 3.5 days | 2-3 days |
| **Days Variance** | Actual minus promised shipping days | 🔴 +0.6 days | ≤0 |

## 💡 Business Recommendations

**1. Investigate First Class SLA commitments**
100% breach rate across all 23 regions suggests promised delivery windows are unachievable. Renegotiate carrier SLAs or adjust customer-facing delivery promises immediately.

**2. Priority intervention: South of USA & Central Africa**
Both regions sit below 40% OTD. Route optimization or regional carrier substitution in these two regions alone would impact 5,722 orders annually.

**3. Scale Standard Class learnings across all modes**
Standard Class is best performer (57.7% OTD, 39.8% breach) at the lowest cost. Understanding what makes it relatively reliable could unlock cross-mode improvements.

**4. Structural fix required — not incremental tweaks**
36 months of flat OTD confirms tactical fixes are not working. A structural review of warehouse dispatch workflows, carrier contracts, and demand forecasting is needed.
